    <p><object type="wood">Trees</object> and <object type="stone">stones</object> have long been objects of deep devotion in <location country="Japan">Japan</location>. Originally there were no shrine buildings; instead a <object type="wood">tree</object>, forest, or a large boulder or a mountain, festooned with <object type="rope">ropes</object>, would be the focus of worship.</p>

    <p>In <location country="Japan">Japan</location> the mysterious forces of nature, called ke, were believed to permeate palpable matter and formless space (collectively called mono in Japanese) to create mononoke. Mononoke was seen to coalesce in trees and stones. Certain trees, especially the cryptomeria and the evergreen sakaki, were considered sacred for this reason. When one of these trees was felled and the <object type="wood">wood</object> used in the construction of a shrine, this sacred quality was believed to follow it into the building. The sacred tree itself was literally and symbolically present in the form of a pillar or post around which the shrine was constructed.</p>

    <p>The great <location landmark="Shinto Shrine">Shinto shrine</location> at <location city="Ise, Japan">Ise</location> is built amid a dense forest of giant cryptomeria trees next to the Isuzu River at the foot of <location landmark ="Mount Kamiji">Mount Kamiji</location> and <location landmark="Mount Shimaji">Mount Shimaji</location> in the Mie Prefecture [see Mie Prefecture] in southern <location island="Honshu, Japan">Honshu, Japan</location>. Crossing the Uji Bridge and passing through the large torii gate marking the entrance to the shrine, a long path leads to Ise Jingu (Ise Grand Shrine).</p>

<p>The shrine consists of two groups of buildings: the <location landmark="Imperial Shrine">Imperial Shrine </location>(Kotai Jingu), also known as the Naiku (inner shrine), and the <location landmark="Toyouke Shrine">Toyouke Shrine</location> (Toyouke Daijingu ) which constitutes the Geku or outer shrine. The Naiku is dedicated to the Sun Goddess Amaterasu Omikami (Heaven-Illuminating Great Deity), and the Geku to the Goddess of Cereals Toyouke Omikami (Abundant Food Great Deity). Each shrine is composed of a number of buildings, including ancillary shrines, workshops, storehouses, etc. Each shrine has an inner precinct with a main sanctuary and two attendant shrines, as well as treasuries, fences, and gates.</p>

    <p>Both shrines are constructed of <object type="wood">wood</object>, and every twenty years both are totally rebuilt on an adjoining site. The empty site of the previous shrine (called the kodenchi) is strewn with large white <object type="stone">pebbles</object>. The only building on the empty site, which retains its sacredness for the intervening twenty years, is a small wooden shed or hut (oi-ya) inside of which is a post about seven feet high known as <location landmark="shin-no-mihashira">shin-no-mihashira</location> (literally the august column of the heart, or more freely translated as sacred central post). The new shrine will be erected over and around this post which are the holiest and most mysterious objects in the Ise Shrine. They remain hidden at all times.</p>
